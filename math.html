                Feynman's Trick
            </h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                The first time that I saw Feynman's trick I was in awe, that was also the time that I started to love evaluating integrals. At that point I was only finishing high school and mostly have dealt with basic integrals, however afterwards I started to approach math as a hobby and evaluating integrals became for me something like a puzzle.. similar to how some people enjoy solve anagrams, sudoku games and so on. Feynman's trick provided a cheat code to deal with integrals. Keep in mind that I wasn't familliar with double integrals (which the trick is in disguise) so that felt somewhat like I was playing chess, but with much more powerful pieces (imagine having the amazon instead of a queen).
			</p>
			<p>
				In order to describe the trick it's easier to just show how an integral is evaluated using this method. We'll start with the following integral:
                $$I=\int_0^1 \frac{x-1}{\ln x}dx$$
            </p>
            <p>
				The first step is to complicate a bit the integral by introducing a new parameter, a dummy variable, which we can call \(t\), thus the integral becomes:
				$$I(t)=\int_0^1 \frac{x^t-1}{\ln x}dx$$
				Keep in mind that our original integral is just \(I(1)\). Also surely, we could've placed the dummy variable in many different places, such as:
				$$I(a)=\int_0^1 \frac{x-a}{\ln x}dx, \quad I(b)=\int_0^1 \frac{x-1}{b-\ln x}dx, \quad I(c)=\int_0^1 \frac{x-1}{\ln (cx)}dx\ ...$$
				The reason why the original \(I(t)\) was chosen is to be seen in the next step, which is to differentiate the integral with respect to \(t\). This looks like:
				$$I'(t)=\int_0^1 \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\frac{x^t-1}{\ln x}\right)dx  = \int_0^1x^tdx=\frac{x^{t+1}}{t+1}\bigg|_0^1 =\frac{1}{t+1}$$
				Notice how easy was to evaluate the integral \(I'(t)=\int_0^1x^tdx\) above, had we kept \(I(a)\) or \(I(b)\) the things wouldn't had simplified at all after differentiating with respect to \(a\) or respectively \(b\).<br>
				We can already sense that the following might be an important question in the future: Where to put the parameter when using Feynman's Trick?
            </p>
            <p>
                But we will worry about that later, for now let's finish the integral as we only found \(I'(t)\).<br>
				Since we are looking to find \(I(t=1)\) we need to integrate \(I'(t)\) back in order to arrive there. Here it's useful to recall that:
				$$\int_a^b f'(x) dx = f(x)\bigg|_a^b$$
				For us \(f(x)\) is just \(I(t)\) in the above expression. Luckily \(I(0)=0\) and as we are looking for \(I=I(1)\) we can replace \(a\) with \(0\) and \(b\) with \(1\) yielding:
				$$I=\int_0^1 I'(t)dt = \int_0^1 \frac{1}{1+t}dt=\ln(1+t)\bigg|_0^1 = \ln 2.$$
				So that's the big picture of Feynman's trick. Imagine trying to beat a shark in a 100m contest, while in the sea we might have no chance to accomplish that, dragging the contest on to the sand it becomes a piece of cake.<br>
				Similarly it goes for integrals, by dragging them into a different realm.
            </p>

				Here is a follow up integral for you in order to practice with the method presented above:
				$$\int_0^1 \frac{x^2-x}{\ln x}dx = ?$$

                The tricky part with this technique is finding how to introduce the parameter so that afterwards we can differentiate under the integral sign. Let's take a look at another example.
            </p>
            <p>
                $$I=\int_0^\infty \frac{\ln(1+x^2+x^4)}{1+x^2}dx$$ Now we can consider: $$I(a)=\int_0^\infty \frac{\ln((1+x^2)a+x^4)}{1+x^2}dx$$ Differentiating under the integral sign with respect to \(a\) gives: $$I'(a)=\int_0^\infty \frac{1+x^2}{(1+x^2)a+x^4}\frac{dx}{1+x^2}=\int_0^\infty
                \frac{1}{x^4+ax^2+a}dx\overset{\large{x=\frac{\sqrt a}{t}}}=\int_0^\infty \frac{\frac{t^2}{\sqrt a}}{t^4+at^2+a}dt$$ $$2I'(a)=\int_0^\infty \frac{\frac{t^2}{\sqrt a}+1}{t^4+at^2+a}dt\Rightarrow I'(a)=\frac{1}{2\sqrt a}\int_0^\infty \frac{t^2+\sqrt
                a}{t^4+at^2+a}dt$$ $$=\frac{1}{2\sqrt a}\int_0^\infty \frac{1+\frac{\sqrt a}{t^2}}{\left(t-\frac{\sqrt a}{t}\right)^2+a+2\sqrt a}dt=\frac{1}{2\sqrt a}\int_0^\infty \frac{d\left(t-\frac{\sqrt a}{t}\right)}{\left(t-\frac{\sqrt a}{t}\right)^2+\left(\sqrt{a+2\sqrt
                a}\,\right)^2}$$ $$=\frac{1}{2\sqrt a}\frac{1}{\sqrt{a+2\sqrt a}}\arctan\left(\frac{t-\frac{\sqrt a}{t}}{\sqrt{a+2\sqrt a}}\right)\bigg|_0^\infty \Rightarrow I'(a)=\frac{\pi}{2\sqrt a}\frac{1}{\sqrt{a+2\sqrt a}}$$ Finally taking in account
                that \(I(0)=0\), using the fundamental theorem of calculus we have: $$I=I(1)-I(0)=\int_0^1 I'(a)da=\frac{\pi}{2}\int_0^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt a \sqrt {a+2\sqrt a}}da\overset{\sqrt a = x}=\pi \int_0^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt{(x+1)^2-1}}dx=\pi\ln(2+\sqrt
                3)$$
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Moving on to a more complicated example, we'll see that sometimes the integral needs to be manipulated a bit at first in order to make room for the parameter. There isn't a general algorithm for this unfortunatelly and mainly you just feel it after having
                more experience.
            </p>

                $$I=\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2}\arctan\left(\frac{2\sin x}{2\cos x -1}\right)\frac{\sin\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)}{\sqrt{\cos x}}dx$$ We'll first do some substitutions until it's clear how to simplify that \(\arctan\) term. $$I=\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2}\arctan\left(\frac{2\sin
                x}{2\cos x -1}\right)\frac{\sin\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)}{\sqrt{\cos x}}dx\overset{\cos x=t}=\frac1{\sqrt 2}\int_0^1 \arctan \left(\frac{2\sqrt{1-t^2}}{2t-1}\right)\frac{dt}{\sqrt t\sqrt{1+t}}\overset{\large t=\frac{1-x}{1+x}}=\int_0^1
                \frac{\arctan\left(\frac{4\sqrt x}{1-3x}\right)}{\sqrt{1-x}(1+x)}dx$$ $$=\int_0^1\frac{\arctan (\sqrt x)+\arctan(3\sqrt x)}{\sqrt{1-x}(1+x)}dx-\int_\frac13^1\frac{\pi}{\sqrt{1-x}(1+x)}dx=\mathcal J-\frac{\pi}{\sqrt2}\ln(2+\sqrt 3)$$ The
                second integral appears since for \(x>\frac13\) we have \(\sqrt x \cdot 3\sqrt x>1\). Now in order to evaluate \(\mathcal J\) we can differentiate under the integral sign, considering: $$\mathcal J(a)=\int_0^1\frac{\arctan(a\sqrt x)+\arctan(3\sqrt
                x)}{\sqrt{1-x}(1+x)}dx$$ $$\Rightarrow \mathcal J'(a)=\int_0^1 \frac{\sqrt x}{\sqrt{1-x}(1+x)(1+a^2 x)}dx\overset{\frac{1-x}{x}=t}=\int_0^\infty \frac{dt}{\sqrt t(2+t)(1+a^2+t)}$$ $$\overset{t=x^2}=\frac{2}{1-a^2}\int_0^\infty \left(\frac{1}{1+a^2+x^2}-\frac{1}{2+x^2}\right)dx=\frac{\pi}{1-a^2}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+a^2}}-\frac{1}{\sqrt
                2}\right)$$ We are looking to find \(\mathcal J(1)=\mathcal J\), but \(\mathcal J(-3)=0\) therefore our integral is: $$\mathcal J=\int_{-3}^1 \frac{\pi}{1-a^2}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+a^2}}-\frac{1}{\sqrt 2}\right)da\overset{-a=\frac{1-x}{1+x}}=\frac{\pi}{2\sqrt
                2}\int_0^2\frac{1}{x}\left(1-\frac{1-x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\right)dx$$ $$=\frac{\pi}{2\sqrt 2}\left(\ln\left(x+\sqrt{1+x^2}\right)+\ln\left(1+\sqrt{1+x^2}\right)\right)\bigg|_0^2=\sqrt 2 \pi \ln \varphi$$ Finally, combining the two results we
                get: $$\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2}\arctan\left(\frac{2\sin x}{2\cos x -1}\right)\frac{\sin\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)}{\sqrt{\cos x}}dx=\sqrt 2 \pi \ln \varphi-\frac{\pi}{\sqrt2}\ln(2+\sqrt 3), \ \varphi = \frac{1+\sqrt 5}{2}.$$
