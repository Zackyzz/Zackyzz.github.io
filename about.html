                        Hello! I'm Zacky - programmer with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, currently pursuing my Master's Degree in Advanced Computing Systems. I am fascinated by Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Quantum Computing and anything related to Artificial Intelligence. I tend to enjoy programming in lesser known programming languages such as Racket, Haskell or Julia and although I'm not really a fan of C++, C#, MatLab or Python I've spent most of the time using those. You can find my GitHub account
                        <a href="https://github.com/Zackyzz">here</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even though my studies were focused on computer science I always kept a special place for mathematics. In high-school I reached the national olympiad and later contributed to some online math forums and magazines
                        such as the Romanian Mathematical Magazine, Crux Mathematicorum, Art of Problem Solving and Mathematics Stack Exchange. You can find my profile on the later one

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Other hobbies of mine includes chess (<a href="https://lichess.org/@/ThreeSidedCoin">lichess profile</a>), video games and cycling.
