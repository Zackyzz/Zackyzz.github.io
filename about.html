                    <p>
                        I'm a programmer with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, currently pursuing my Master's Degree in Advanced Computing Systems. I am fascinated by Artificial intelligence, especially of Machine Learning - a field in which I'd love to work one day.
                        I also enjoy programming in esoteric programming languages such as Lisp or Haskell and although I'm not really a fan of any language that is popular (C++, C#, Java, Python) I've spent most of the time using those. You can find
                        my GitHub account <a href="https://github.com/Zackyzz">here</a>.

                        Even though my studies were focused on computer science and related fields I always had a special place for mathematics, especially when it's about integrals or series. In high school I participated in some math olympiads and later I have contributed
                        to some online math forums and magazines such as the Romanian Mathematical Magazine, Crux Mathematicorum, Art of Problem Solving and Mathematics Stack Exchange. You can find my profile on the later one

                        Other hobbies of mine includes chess (<a href="https://lichess.org/@/ThreeSidedCoin">lichess profile</a>) and cycling. I'd love to hear about yours too, feel free to say hi anytime.
