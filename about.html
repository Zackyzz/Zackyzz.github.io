                        I'm a programmer with an engineer Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, currently pursuing my Master's Degree in Advanced Computing Systems. I am fascinated by Machine Learning and any field related to Artificial Intelligence, one day I'd love to take
                        it one step further and work or research in this field. I also enjoy programming in functional programming languages such as Lisp or Haskell and although I'm not really a fan of any language that is popular such as C++, C#, Java
                        or Python I've spent most of the time using those. You can find my GitHub account <a href="https://github.com/Zackyzz">here</a>.

                        Even though my studies were focused on computer science and related fields I always had a special place for mathematics, especially when it's about integrals or series. I participated in some olympiads and later I have contributed to sox`me online math
                        forums and magazines such as the Romanian Mathematical Magazine, Crux Mathematicorum, Art of Problem Solving and Mathematics Stack Exchange. You can find my profile on the later one

                        Other hobbies of mine includes chess (<a href="https://lichess.org/@/ThreeSidedCoin">lichess profile</a>) and cycling. Feel free to say hi anytime, I'd love to hear about you and yours hobbies too!
