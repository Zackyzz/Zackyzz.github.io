                Hello! I'm Zacky - programmer with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, currently pursuing my Master's Degree in Advanced Computing Systems. I am fascinated by Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Quantum Computing and mostly anything related to Artificial Intelligence. I tend to enjoy using programming languages that aren't exceedingly popular such as Racket, Julia or Haskell, however I've spent most of the time using Python, C, C++, C# or MatLab. You can find my GitHub account

                Even though my studies were focused on computer science I always had a special place for mathematics. In high-school I reached the national olympiad and later contributed to some online math forums and magazines such as the Romanian Mathematical Magazine, Crux Mathematicorum, Art of Problem Solving and Mathematics Stack Exchange. You can find my profile on the later one

                Other hobbies of mine includes chess, video games and cycling.
