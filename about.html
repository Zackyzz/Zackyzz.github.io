                        You can call me Zacky. I'm a programmer with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, currently pursuing my Master's Degree in Advanced Computing Systems. I am fascinated by Machine Learning and any field related to Artificial Intelligence. I also enjoy
                        programming in functional programming languages such as Lisp and although I'm not really a fan of any language that is popular such as C++, C#, Java or Python I've spent most of the time using those. You can find my GitHub account
                        <a href="https://github.com/Zackyzz">here</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even though my studies were focused on computer science I always kept a special place for mathematics, especially when it's about integrals or series. I participated in some olympiads and later I have contributed to some online math forums and magazines
                        such as the Romanian Mathematical Magazine, Crux Mathematicorum, Art of Problem Solving and Mathematics Stack Exchange. You can find my profile on the later one

                        Other hobbies of mine includes chess (<a href="https://lichess.org/@/ThreeSidedCoin">lichess profile</a>) and cycling.
