        <p>
            The previous chapter emphasized to parameterise integrals so that something from the integral, which is not related to the parameter, gets simplified when differentiating (if possible). However there are times when even though we can introduce a parameter to accomplish that, it still wouldn't be enough to finish the integral.
        </p>

        <p>
            In this chapter we will look at a different way to obtain this simplification. Let's start by looking at a modified version of an integral that was previously given as an exercise:
        </p>

        <div class="jaxmath">
            \[I=\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{e^{-x^2}}{1+x^4}dx\]
        </div>

        <p>
            With \(\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{e^{-x^2}}{1+x^2}dx\) it was quite direct to parameterise the integral as \(\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{e^{-t(1+x^2)}}{1+x^2}dx\) since it simplifies the denominator, however the similar way to do that for our integral: \(\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{e^{-x^2-t(1+x^4)}}{1+x^4}dx\) doesn't seem to work as it complicates things a bit too much.
        </p>

        <p>
            There is however a way to simplify the denominator and in the same time to obtain a decent integral afterwards. Without any explanation I will parameterise the integral as:
        </p>

        <div class="jaxmath">
            \[I(t)=\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{e^{-x^2}}{1+x^4} e^{-tx^2}(x^2\sin t+\cos t) dx\]
        </div>

        <p>
            This will seem obscure, but fear not as we will never use this approach again.
            The whole point is to simplify \(1+x^4\) and the above function was created explicitly to achieve that, as \(\frac{\partial}{\partial t}e^{-tx^2}(x^2\sin t+\cos t)\) is \(-(1+x^4)e^{-tx^2}\sin t\). Note that even though we introduced a couple other terms, those aren't disturbing.
        </p>
        
        <div class="jaxmath">
            \[I'(t)=-\sin t\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-x^2}e^{-tx^2}dx \overset{(1+t)x^2\to x^2}= -\frac{\sin t}{\sqrt{1+t}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-x^2}dx=-\sqrt \pi \frac{\sin t}{\sqrt{1+t}}\]
        </div>

        <p>
            Here we are looking to find \(I=I(0)\) and also \(I(t\to\infty)=0\), therefore we have:
        </p>

        <div class="jaxmath">
            \[I=-\int_0^\infty I'(t)dt=\sqrt \pi \int_0^\infty \frac{\sin t}{\sqrt{1+t}}dt\overset{\sqrt{1+t}=x}=2\sqrt \pi \int_1^\infty \sin(x^2-1)dx\]
            \[=2\sqrt{\pi} \cos 1 \int_1^\infty\sin(x^2)dx-2\sqrt{\pi} \sin  1 \int_1^\infty\cos(x^2)dx\]
            \[=\pi\cos 1\frac{1-2S\left(\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}}\right)}{\sqrt 2}-\pi\sin 1\frac{1-2C\left(\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}}\right)}{\sqrt 2}\]
        </div>

        <p>
            Where \(S(x)\) and \(C(x)\) are Fresnel integrals, however the approach is important here, not the result itself.
        </p>

        <p>
            We can avoid the parametrisation from above by directly using \(\frac{1}{1+x^4}=\int_0^\infty e^{-tx^2}\sin t \, dt\) and switch to double integrals, or put in other words: employ the <span class ="important">accelerated Feynman's trick</span> (meaning that we skip the usual parameterisation step).
        </p>

        <div class="jaxmath">
            \[I=\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{e^{-x^2}}{1+x^4}dx = \int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-x^2}\int_0^\infty e^{-tx^2}\sin t \, dtdx\]
            \[=\int_{0}^\infty \sin t\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-x^2}e^{-tx^2}dxdt\overset{(1+t)x^2\to x^2}=\sqrt{\pi}\int_0^\infty \frac{\sin t}{\sqrt{1+t}}dt\]
        </div>

        <p>
            The rest goes exactly as with the previous method as all we did here was to skip differentiating with respect to the newly parameterised integral and instead we switched to double integrals.
        </p>

        <p>
            A natural question that arises here is how did \(\frac{1}{1+x^4}=\int_0^\infty e^{-tx^2}\sin t dt\) appear? Or even better, how can on come up with similar results for other integrals? In the case from above simply the Laplace transform of the sine function was used, however in general it's useful to have a list of such identities. There are tables of integral results that can be used - for example: Table of Integrals, Series, and Products by Gradshteyn and Ryzhik - alternatively one can build up their own list of results which tend to appear often while evaluating other integrals.
        </p>

        <p>
            A few useful of them are:
        </p>

        <div class ="jaxmath">
            \[\int_0^\infty e^{-xt}\sin t dt =\frac{1}{1+x^2}, \quad \int_0^\infty e^{-xt} dt = \frac{1}{x}, \quad \int_0^\infty e^{-xt^2}dt = \frac{\sqrt \pi}{2\sqrt x}\]
            \[\int_0^1 \frac{\ln t}{t-\frac{1}{x}}dt = \operatorname{Li}_2(x), \quad \int_0^x \frac{\arctan t}{1+xt}dt = \frac{\arctan x \ln(1+x^2)}{2x}\]
        </div>

        <hr>

        <p>
            Let's conclude this chapter by evaluating one of the most popular integrals that appears when Feynman's trick gets into the conversation, namely:
        </p>
            
        <div class="jaxmath">
            \[I=\int_0^\infty \frac{\sin x}{x}dx\]
        </div>

        <p>
            Since \(\int_0^\infty e^{-xt} dt = \frac{1}{x}\) we can make use of this to rewrite the integral as:
        </p>

        <div class="jaxmath">
            \[I=\int_0^\infty \int_0^\infty \sin x e^{-xt}dtdx = \int_0^\infty \int_0^\infty \sin x e^{-xt}dxdt=\int_0^\infty \frac{1}{1+t^2}dt =\frac{\pi}{2}\]
        </div>

        <p>
            Alternatively we can also consider the parameter version of this integral: \(\int_0^\infty \frac{\sin x}{x}e^{-xt}dx\), however I feel like switching to double integrals is way more intuitively.
        </p>

        <p>
            It might be worth to highlight again that this method should be used preferable when parameterising the integral leads to nowhere. For the above integral the natural introduction of \(\int_0^\infty \frac{\sin(tx)}{x}dx\) unfortunatelly does fail, as we obtain a divergent integral after differentiating under the integral sign.
        </p>

        <p>
            Like in the previous chapter below are more integrals alongside some hints in order to practice. However in this case I do recommend to take a peek at the hints faster in case nothing obvious comes immediate to mind.
        </p>

        <div class ="jaxmath">
                \[\int_0^\infty \sin(x^2)dx=?\]
        </div>

        <div class="hidden-hint">
            <p class="hint">
                Start by substituting \(x^2\to x\) and then switch to double integrals using:
                \[\int_0^\infty e^{-xt^2}dt = \frac{\sqrt \pi}{2\sqrt x}\]
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class ="jaxmath">
            \[\int_0^\infty \frac{\operatorname{Li}_2(x)}{x\sqrt{1-x^2}}dx=?\]
        </div>

        <div class="hidden-hint">
            <p class="hint">
                Switch directly to double integrals by using:
                \[\int_0^1 \frac{\ln t}{t-\frac{1}{x}}dt = \operatorname{Li}_2(x)\]
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class ="jaxmath">
                \[\int_0^1 \frac{\arctan x}{x}\ln\left(\frac{(1+x^2)^3}{(1+x)^2}\right)dx=?\]
        </div>

        <div class="hidden-hint">
            <p class="hint">
                Start by splitting the integral into two parts, namely:
                \[3\int_0^1 \frac{\arctan x\ln(1+x^2)}{x}dx-2\int_0^1 \frac{\arctan x\ln(1+x)}{x}dx\]
                Afterwards employ the accelerated Feynman's trick to the first integral, using:
                \[\int_0^x \frac{\arctan t}{1+xt}dt = \frac{\arctan x \ln(1+x^2)}{2x}\]
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class ="jaxmath">
            \[\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{x}{\pi^2+x^2}\frac{e^{2x}}{(1+e^{x})^3}dx\]

        <div class="hidden-hint">
            <p class="hint">
                Consider switching to double integrals with:
                \[\frac{x}{\pi^2+x^2}=\Im\left(-\frac{1}{\pi+ix}\right)=-\Im\int_0^\infty e^{-(\pi+ix)t}dt\]
                It's also really useful to try and see what happens when the Laplace transform of the cosine function is used instead, or the equivalent:
                \[\frac{x}{\pi^2+x^2}=\Re\left(\frac{1}{i\pi+x}\right)=\Re\int_0^\infty e^{-(i\pi+x)t}dt\]
