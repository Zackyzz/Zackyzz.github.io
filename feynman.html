        <h1>
            Feynman's Trick
        </h1>
        <p>
            Among a few other integral tricks and techniques, Feynman's trick was a strong reason that made me love
            evaluating integrals and although the method goes back to Leibniz, sometimes being called <span class ="important">Leibniz integral
            rule</span>, Feynman was the one who popularized it - that's why it is mostly refered to as <span class ="important">Feynman's trick</span>.
            Here's an excerpt from his book <span class ="important">Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman</span>:
        </p>
        <p class="citation">
                "One thing I never did learn was contour integration. I had learned to do integrals 
                by various methods shown in a book that my high school physics teacher Mr. Bader had given me.
            </p>
            <p class="citation">
                One day he told me to stay after class. "Feynman," he said, "you talk too much and you make too much noise.
                I know why. You're bored. So I'm going to give you a book. You go up there in the back, in the corner, and
                study this book, and when you know everything that's in this book, you can talk again."
            </p>
            <p class="citation">
                So every physics class, I paid no attention to what was going on with Pascal's Law, or whatever they were
                doing. I was up in the back with this book: Advanced Calculus, by Woods. Bader knew I had studied Calculus
                for the Practical Man a little bit, so he gave me the real works -- it was for a junior or senior course
                in college. It had Fourier series, Bessel functions, determinants, elliptic functions -- all kinds of
                wonderful stuff that I didn't know anything about.
            </p>
            <p class="citation">
                That book also showed how to differentiate parameters under the integral sign -- it's a certain operation.
                It turns out that's not taught very much in the universities; they don't emphasize it. But I caught on
                how to use that method, and I used that one damn tool again and again. So because I was self-taught using
                that book, I had peculiar methods of doing integrals.
            </p>
            <p class="citation">
                The result was, when guys at MIT or Princeton had trouble doing a certain integral, it was because they
                couldn't do it with the standard methods they had learned in school. If it was contour integration, they
                would have found it; if it was a simple series expansion, they would have found it. Then I come along and
                try differentiating under the integral sign, and often it worked. So I got a great reputation for doing
                integrals, only because my box of tools was different from everybody else's, and they had tried all their
                tools on it before giving the problem to me."         
            </p>
        </p>

        <p>
            For me employing the trick felt like I was using cheat codes to deal with integrals while in the same
            time it enabled a lot of creativity and wishful thinking which at heart transformed the integrals into puzzles.
            Unfortunately in the same time this also means that there's not a clear path on how and when exactly to use
            this technique. In addition what Feynman wrote still applies today as the method isn't taught much or at all in
            universities - this means that the trick often comes as obscure and hard to grasp for newcomers.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the following we will go into a journey to find some rules of thumb to have at disposal when using Feynman's trick.
            It should be mentioned right from the start that those rules of thumb are merely some heuristics that I tend to use, 
            so deviating from them can be totally fine. However I'm hoping that it can provide a path to have in case nothing
            obvious or intuitively occurs when someone tries to use this trick, or even better a reason for someone to start using the method.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <section id="chapter1"> <h3>Hello, World!</h3> </section>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Feynman already gave quite a big spoiler to what the trick is about when he mentioned <span class ="important">differentiating under
            the integral sign</span> - this also being an alternative name for the technique.
            More explicitly, if \(f(x,t)\) is well-behaved then the following holds:
            $$\frac{d}{dt} \int_a^b f(x, t)dx = \int_a^b \frac{\partial f(x, t)}{\partial t}dx$$
        <p>
            This is nice, however not so useful by itself. One common thing that tends to
            happen while approaching something new, be it a game, a programming language or even a field is that 
            without practice nothing would stick. Take for example chess, most people could understand the rules in a few 
            minutes, however if they would go on to play a game most likely they would get stomped by a more experienced
            player while playing under the same rules, solely because the other player through practice learned some
            techniques to follow when playing. Therefore I would like here to jump straightforward into practice in order
            to get familiar with the trick.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a "Hello, World!" example let's take the following integral:
            $$I=\int_0^1 \frac{x-1}{\ln x}dx$$
            You are encouraged to try and evaluate the integral with basic methods, but the logarithm being in the
            denominator makes this integral quite stubborn to deal with. Feynman's trick aims to get rid of this issue
            - that is, to differentiate under the intgeral sign with respect to a parameter in order to obtain an
            integral that is easier to evaluate.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately in the integral from above we lack a parameter, therefore the first step is to parameterise the integral, which can even mean introducing a whole function, but for this one a simple parameter is enough:
            $$I(t)=\int_0^1 \frac{x^t-1}{\ln x}dx$$
            Keep in mind that our original integral is just \(I(1)\). Also, surely we could've placed parameter in many
            different places, such as:
            $$I(a)=\int_0^1 \frac{x-a}{\ln x}dx, \quad I(b)=\int_0^1 \frac{x-1}{b-\ln x}dx, \quad I(c)=\int_0^1 \frac{x-1}{\ln (cx)}dx\ ...$$
            However the main idea behind the trick, as mentioned above, is to obtain an integral that we can evaluate
            easier after differentiating with respect to the new parameter. Let's put this in action and see what happens to \(I(t)\).
            $$I'(t)=\int_0^1 \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\frac{x^t-1}{\ln x}\right)dx  = \int_0^1x^tdx = \frac{x^{t+1}}{t+1}\bigg|_0^1 = \frac{1}{t+1}$$
            Notice how easy it was to evaluate the integral \(I'(t)=\int_0^1x^tdx\) from above, had we kept \(I(a)\), \(I(b)\)
            or \(I(c)\) the things wouldn't had simplified after differentiating and most devastating is that we would still
            be left with the \(\ln x\) in the denominator, a thing which made the integral hard to deal with in the first place.
        </p>
        <p>
            We can already sense that the following might be an important question in the future:
            <span class ="important">How to parameterise the integral when using Feynman's Trick?</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            But we will worry about that later, for now let's finish the integral as we only found \(I'(t)\).
            Since we are looking to find \(I(1)\) we need to integrate \(I'(t)\) back and set \(t=1\) in order to arrive there.
            Here it's useful to recall that:
            $$\int_a^b f'(x) dx = f(b)-f(a)$$
            For us \(f(x)\) is just \(I(t)\) in the above expression. Luckily \(I(0)=0\) and as we are looking for
            \(I=I(1)\) we can replace \(a\) with \(0\) and \(b\) with \(1\) yielding:
            $$I= I(1)-I(0)=\int_0^1 I'(t)dt = \int_0^1 \frac{1}{1+t}dt=\ln(1+t)\bigg|_0^1 = \ln 2.$$
            So that's the big picture of how Feynman's trick works - we have an integral that is hard to evaluate
            it's original form, therefore by differentiating under the integral sign
            we attempt to transform the integral so that it can be easier integrated and in the end we go back to
            undo the differentiation step.
        </p>

        <hr>
        <section id="chapter2"> <h3>The parameter</h3> </section>
        <hr>
        <p>
            As emphasized above the main goal of the trick is to obtain an integral that is easier to evaluate after
            differentiating with respect to a parameter and one issue is that it is not always obvious where to place it.
            In order to develop some heuristics let's take the following integral.
            $$I=\int_0^1 \frac{\ln(1+x)}{1+x^2}dx$$
            The most annoying thing for us is the logarithm, so if we get rid of it everything should be straightforward.
            There are a few parameter possibilities which makes sense to consider, namely:
            $$I(a)=\int_0^1\frac{\ln(a+x)}{1+x^2}dx, \quad I(b) = \int_0^1 \frac{\ln(1+bx)}{1+x^2}dx$$
            With the first one we are out of luck, as differentiating with respect to \(a\) gives:
            $$I'(a)=\int_0^1 \frac{1}{(a+x)(1+x^2)}dx = \frac{1}{1+a^2}\int_0^1\left(\frac{1}{a+x}+\frac{a}{1+x^2}-\frac{x}{1+x^2}\right)dx$$
            $$=\frac{\ln(1+a)}{1+a^2}-\frac{\ln a}{1+a^2} +\frac{\pi}{4}\frac{a}{1+a^2}-\frac{\ln 2}{2}\frac{1}{1+a^2}$$
            Therefore if we would try to go back to what we're looking, which is \(I(1)\), we would end up with
            \(I=I+\text{other stuff}\). This cancels out \(I\) and we wouldn't be able to recover it.
            Unfortunately there's no magic formula that tells a priori whether placing a parameter in a specific place would
            succeed or fail dealing with an integral and sometimes we are simply unlucky.
        </p>
        <p>
            In contrast, things work out nicely with the second choice from above as:
            $$I'(b)=\int_0^1\frac{x}{(1+bx)(1+x^2)}dx=\frac{1}{1+b^2}\int_0^1\left(\frac{b}{1+x^2}+\frac{x}{1+x^2}-\frac{b}{1+bx}\right)dx$$
            $$=\frac{\pi}{4}\frac{b}{1+b^2}+\frac{\ln 2}{2}\frac{1}{1+b^2}-\frac{\ln(1+b)}{1+b^2}$$
            Again, we are looking to find \(I(1)\) and as \(I(0) = 0\) we have:
            $$I=\int_0^1 I'(b)db \Rightarrow 2I=\int_0^1 \left(\frac{\pi}{4}\frac{b}{1+b^2}+\frac{\ln 2}{2}\frac{1}{1+b^2}\right)db \Rightarrow I=\frac{\pi}{8}\ln 2$$
        </p>
        <p>
            This works, but we can even do better. The first thing that I always attempt to look for when using Feynman's trick is to simplify something from the integrand when differentiating. Surely above we got rid of the logarithm, but the denominator remained intact. Looking at the "Hello, World!" integral we can see that there we simplified the logarithm in the denominator while performing \(\frac{\partial}{\partial t}x^t\).
        </p>
        <p>
            In short this will be our first rule of thumb: <span class ="important">if possible, place the parameter so that something from the integral, which is not related to the parameter, gets simplified</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to achieve this with our integral we would need to get rid of \(1+x^2\) and by using \(\ln x=\frac12\ln(x^2)\) we can rewrite the integral as:
            $$I=\int_0^1\frac{\ln(1+x)}{1+x^2}dx=\frac12\int_0^1\frac{\ln(1+2x+x^2)}{1+x^2}dx$$
        </p>
        <p>
            For this one it's more naturally to choose the parameter so that it simplifies \(1+x^2\) when differentiating with respect to \(t\), namely we consider:
            $$I(t)=\frac12\int_0^1 \frac{\ln(2x+t(1+x^2))}{1+x^2}dx\Rightarrow I'(t)=\frac12\int_0^1 \frac{1}{2x+t(1+x^2)}dx=\frac14\frac{\ln\left(\frac{1+\sqrt{1-t^2}}{t}\right)}{\sqrt{1-t^2}}$$
            Similarly to \(I(b)\) we are looking to find \(I(1)\), however here \(I(0)\) is equal to \(\frac12\int_0^1\frac{\ln(2x)}{1+x^2}dx\) not \(0\), so:
            $$I=I(1)-I(0)+I(0)=\frac14\int_0^1\frac{\ln\left(\frac{1+\sqrt{1-t^2}}{t}\right)}{\sqrt{1-t^2}}dt+\frac12\int_0^1\frac{\ln(2x)}{1+x^2}dx$$
            $$\int_0^1\frac{\ln\left(\frac{1+\sqrt{1-t^2}}{t}\right)}{\sqrt{1-t^2}}dt\overset{\frac{1+\sqrt{1-t^2}}{t}=x}=-2\int_0^1 \frac{\ln x}{1+x^2}dx\Rightarrow I = \frac12\int_0^1 \frac{\ln 2}{1+x^2}dx=\frac{\pi}{8}\ln 2$$
            For this specific integral we only avoided performing partial fractions so there wasn't really a big improvement by simplifying the denominator. However I want to emphasize the importance of this rule of thumb because it will make things come way more natural when deciding where place the parameter. Of course, in case there's not an appropiate or immediate way to achieve this, it's perfectly fine to place the parameter elsewhere too.
        </p>
        <p>
            As mentioned previously, practicing is the best approach to get along with this technique, therefore for you below are more integrals to evaluate alongside some hidden steps in case those will be needed, however I strongly recommend to try and deal with the integrals before looking at any hints and only check them afterwards for correctness.

        <hr>
        <p>
            The previous chapter emphasized to parameterise integrals so that something from the integral, which is not related to the parameter, gets simplified when differentiating (if possible). However there are times when even though we can introduce a parameter to accomplish that, it still wouldn't be enough to finish the integral.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this chapter we will look at a different way to obtain this simplification. Let's start by looking at a modified version of an integral that was previously given as an exercise:
            $$I=\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{e^{-x^2}}{1+x^4}dx$$
            With \(\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{e^{-x^2}}{1+x^2}dx\) it was quite direct to parameterise the integral as \(\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{e^{-t(1+x^2)}}{1+x^2}dx\) since it simplifies the denominator, however the similar way to do that for our integral: \(\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{e^{-x^2-t(1+x^4)}}{1+x^4}dx\) doesn't seem to work as it complicates things a bit too much.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is however a way to simplify the denominator and in the same time to obtain a decent integral afterwards. Without any explanation I will parameterise the integral as:
            $$I(t)=\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{e^{-x^2}}{1+x^4} e^{-tx^2}(x^2\sin t+\cos t) dx$$
        </p>
        <p>
            This will seem obscure, but fear not as we will never use this approach again.
            The whole point is to simplify \(1+x^4\) and the above function was made explicitly to achieve that, as \(\frac{\partial}{\partial t}e^{-tx^2}(x^2\sin t+\cos t)=-(1+x^4)e^{-tx^2}\sin t\). Note that even though we introduced a couple other terms, those aren't disturbing.
            $$ I'(t)=-\sin t\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-x^2}e^{-tx^2}dx \overset{(1+t)x^2\to x^2}= -\frac{\sin t}{\sqrt{1+t}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-x^2}dx=-\sqrt \pi \frac{\sin t}{\sqrt{1+t}}$$
            Here we are looking to find \(I=I(0)\) and also \(I(t\to\infty)=0\), therefore we have:
            $$I=-\int_0^\infty I'(t)dt=\sqrt \pi \int_0^\infty \frac{\sin t}{\sqrt{1+t}}dt\overset{\sqrt{1+t}=x}=2\sqrt \pi \int_1^\infty \sin(x^2-1)dx$$
            $$=2\sqrt{\pi} \cos 1 \int_1^\infty\sin(x^2)dx-2\sqrt{\pi} \sin  1 \int_1^\infty\cos(x^2)dx$$
            $$=\pi\cos 1\frac{1-2S\left(\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}}\right)}{\sqrt 2}-\pi\sin 1\frac{1-2C\left(\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}}\right)}{\sqrt 2}$$
            Where \(S(x)\) and \(C(x)\) are Fresnel integrals, however the result itself isn't that important here.
        </p>
        <p>
            We can avoid the parametrisation from above by directly using \(\frac{1}{1+x^4}=\int_0^\infty e^{-tx^2}\sin t dt\) and switch to double integrals, or as it was called in this chapter's title we will employ the accelerated Feynman's trick (meaning that we skip the usual parameterisation step):
            $$I=\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{e^{-x^2}}{1+x^4}dx = \int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-x^2}\int_0^\infty e^{-tx^2}\sin t dtdx$$
            $$=\int_{0}^\infty \sin t\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-x^2}e^{-tx^2}dxdt\overset{(1+t)x^2\to x^2}=\sqrt{\pi}\int_0^\infty \frac{\sin t}{\sqrt{1+t}}dt$$
        </p>
        <p>
            The rest goes exactly as with the previous method as all we did here was to skip differentiating with respect to the newly parameterised integral and instead we switched to double integrals.
        </p>
        <p>
            A natural question that arises here is how did \(\frac{1}{1+x^4}=\int_0^\infty e^{-tx^2}\sin t dt\) appear? Or even better, how can on come up with similar results for other integrals? In the case from above simply the Laplace transform was used, however in general it's useful to have a list of such results. There are tables of integral results that can be used, for example one from the book Table of Integrals, Series, and Products by Gradshteyn and Ryzhik.
            We are however going to use only a few of them, some being:
            $$\int_0^\infty e^{-xt}\sin t dt =\frac{1}{1+x^2}, \quad \int_0^\infty e^{-xt} dt = \frac{1}{x}, \quad \int_0^\infty e^{-xt^2}dt = \frac{\sqrt \pi}{2\sqrt x}$$
            $$\int_0^1 \frac{\ln t}{t-\frac{1}{x}}dt = \operatorname{Li}_2(x), \quad \int_0^x \frac{\arctan t}{1+xt}dt = \frac{\arctan x \ln(1+x^2)}{2x}$$
        <hr>
            Let's conclude this chapter by evaluating one of the most popular integrals that appears when Feynman's trick gets into the conversation, namely:
            $$I=\int_0^\infty \frac{\sin x}{x}dx$$
            Since \(\int_0^\infty e^{-xt} dt = \frac{1}{x}\) we can make use of this to rewrite the integral as:
            $$I=\int_0^\infty \int_0^\infty \sin x e^{-xt}dtdx = \int_0^\infty \int_0^\infty \sin x e^{-xt}dxdt=\int_0^\infty \frac{1}{1+t^2}dt =\frac{\pi}{2}$$
            Alternatively we can also consider the parameter version of this integral: \(\int_0^\infty \frac{\sin x}{x}e^{-xt}dx\), however I feel like switching to double integrals is way more intuitively.
        </p>
        <p>
            It might be worth to highlight again that this method should be used preferable when parameterising the integral fails. For the above integral the natural introduction of \(\int_0^\infty \frac{\sin(tx)}{x}dx\) unfortunatelly does fail, as we obtain a divergent integral after differentiating under the integral sign.

        <section id="chapter4"> <h3>Reversed Feynman's trick</h3> </section>
        <hr>

        <p>
            So far we've seen the same steps when employing Feynman's trick, namely we parameterised the integrals followed by differentiating them under the integral sign and then to undo the last step we integrate back. There are however some cases we would actually get a much easier integral if we would integrate instead of differentiating the newly parameterised integral. Let's make this more clear by looking at the following integral:
            $$I = \int_0^1 x \ln x\, dx$$
            We can remember from the "Hello, World!" integral that \(\frac{\partial}{\partial t}x^t = x^t \ln x\) and looking at the right hand side, if we would set \(t=1\) then we would end up with the integrand of \(I\), however it is much easier to deal the left hand side integrand, \(x^t\). Therefore in order to evaluate this integral we will perform the reversed Feynman's trick:
            $$I'(t) = \int_0^1 x^t\ln x\, dx \Leftrightarrow I(t)=\int_0^1 x^tdx$$
            As mentioned above indirectly, we are looking here to find \(I'(1)\), so this is over quite quickly as:
            $$I(t)=\int_0^1 x^t dx = \frac{1}{1+t} \Rightarrow I'(t) = -\frac{1}{(1+t)^2} \Rightarrow I'(1)=-\frac{1}{4}$$
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            The whole point of the above was to get a glimpse of what is meant by this specific method. Now let's go deeper by considering the following double integral:
            $$I=\int_0^1\int_0^1 \left(\frac{-\ln(xy)}{1-xy}\right)^mdxdy$$
            In order to generate the \(\ln(xy)\) part it's straightforward as we will do exactly as with the previous integral, namely we can introduce:
            $$I(a)=\int_0^1\int_0^1 \frac{(xy)^a}{(1-xy)^m}dxdy$$
            And then differentiating with respect to \(a\), \(m\) times followed by setting \(a=0\) will gives us the desired integral. However the denominator is still troublesome and to deal with that we will even introduce one more parameter:
            $$I(a,z)=\int_0^1\int_0^1 \frac{(xy)^a}{z-xy}dxdy$$
            This is perfect as it's way easier to evaluate the integral from above and also we can recover our original integral by differentiating with respect to \(a\), \(m\) times and with respect to \(z\), \(m-1\) times followed by setting \(a=0\) and respectively \(z=1\), ignoring some coefficients.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to evaluate \(I(a,z)\) we can expand the denominator into geometric series:
            $$I(a,z)=\int_0^1\int_0^1 \frac{(xy)^a}{z-xy}dxdy=\frac{1}{z}\sum_{n=0}^\infty \int_0^1\int_0^1(xy)^a\left(\frac{xy}{z}\right)^ndxdy$$
            $$=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{z^{n+1}}\int_0^1x^{n+a}dx\int_0^1y^{n+a}dy=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{z^{n+2}}\frac{1}{(n+a)^2}$$
            Now taking \(m\) derivatives with respect to \(a\) and setting it to \(0\) yields:
            $$\frac{\partial^m}{\partial a^m}I(a,z) = \int_0^1\int_0^1 \frac{\ln^m(xy)}{z-xy} dxdy =(-1)^m (m+1)!\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{z^{n+2}}\frac{1}{n^{m+2}}$$
            This can be also rewriten using the polylogarithm function as:
            $$\int_0^1\int_0^1 \frac{(-\ln(xy))^m}{z-xy} dxdy = (m+1)!\operatorname{Li}_{m+2}\left(\frac{1}{z}\right)$$
            Finally we can arrive at our original integral by taking \(m-1\) derivatives with respect to \(z\) and setting it to \(1\):
            $$\frac{\partial^m\partial^{m-1}}{\partial a^m \partial z^{m-1}}I(a,z)=(-1)^m(m-1)!\int_0^1\int_0^1 \frac{(-\ln(xy))^m}{(1-xy)^m}dxdy$$
            $$=(m+1)!\frac{d^{m-1}}{dz^{m-1}}\operatorname{Li}_{m+2}\left(\frac{1}{z}\right)\bigg|_{z=1}$$
            Although this was the important part, by using \(\frac{\partial}{\partial z} \operatorname{Li}_n(z) = \frac{\operatorname{Li}_{n-1}(z)}{z}\) the result can be also written as:
            $$\int_0^1\int_0^1 \left(\frac{-\ln(xy)}{1-xy}\right)^m dxdy =m(m+1)\sum_{k=1}^{m-1}|s(m-1,m-k)|\zeta(k+2)$$
            Where \(s(n,m)\) is the Stirling number of the first kind and \(\zeta(z)\) is the Riemann zeta function.

            To summarise, the point of this chapter was to show that sometimes it can be useful to avoid performing the usual step of parameterising an integral followed by differentiating it. Instead to solve initially an integrated version of the parameterised integral and in the end to differentiate the result.

            With all the previous integrals there was a common thing: we were able to parameterise them as they appeared in their original form, however most of the time we don't have this luxury and we need to manipulate the integrals up to a point where we can introduce a parameter. Our goal here will be to find a few heuristics that will help us in manipulating the integrals up to a point where Feynman's trick will be of any help.
        </p>

        <hr>
        <p>
            Consistence is quite important when dealing with integral. We will see what exactly is meant by that when dealing with the following integral:
            $$I=\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2}\ln(2+\tan^2 x)dx$$
            Two possible ways to parameterise the integral are as follows:
            $$I(a)=\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2}\ln(a+\tan^2 x)dx,\quad I(b)=\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2}\ln(2+b\tan^2 x)dx$$
            Turns out both works, but we can do better. Another rule of thumb that I tend to use is to <span class ="important">stick with rational functions</span> as they often provide the most visibility to work with. Let's do that for our integral too:
            $$I=\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2}\ln(2+\tan^2 x)dx\overset{\tan x\to x}=\int_0^\infty \frac{\ln(2+x^2)}{1+x^2}dx$$
            At this point, if we remember the first rule of thumb, then it should be obvious where to place the parameter so that we can simplify the denominator. We have:
            $$I(t)=\int_0^\infty \frac{\ln(1+t(1+x^2))}{1+x^2}dx\Rightarrow I'(t)=\int_0^\infty \frac{1}{1+t+tx^2}dx=\frac{\pi}{2}\frac{1}{\sqrt t\sqrt{1+t}}$$
            Let's finish this integral too as we are looking for \(I=I(1)\) with \(I(0) = 0\):
            $$I=\int_0^1I'(t)dt=\frac{\pi}{2}\int_0^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt t\sqrt{1+t}}dx\overset{t=x^2}=\pi\int_0^1\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}dx=\pi\ln(1+\sqrt 2)$$
            Obviously, if you're more used to trigonometric functions then this can be simply ignored. I however tend to switch fast to rational functions, a few exceptions being when there's a clear way to parameterise the integral or when at least one of the bounds is \(\infty\).
