        <h1>
            Feynman's Trick
        </h1>
        <p>
            Among a few other integral tricks and techniques, Feynman's trick was a strong influence that made me love
            evaluating integrals and although the method goes back to Leibniz, sometimes being called <b>Leibniz integral
            rule</b>, Feynman was the one who popularized it -- that's why it is often refered to as <b>Feynman's trick</b>.
            Here's an excerpt from his book <i>Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman</i>:
        </p>
        <p class="citation">
                "One thing I never did learn was contour integration. I had learned to do integrals 
                by various methods shown in a book that my high school physics teacher Mr. Bader had given me.
            </p>
            <p class="citation">
                One day he told me to stay after class. "Feynman," he said, "you talk too much and you make too much noise.
                I know why. You're bored. So I'm going to give you a book. You go up there in the back, in the corner, and
                study this book, and when you know everything that's in this book, you can talk again."
            </p>
            <p class="citation">
                So every physics class, I paid no attention to what was going on with Pascal's Law, or whatever they were
                doing. I was up in the back with this book: Advanced Calculus, by Woods. Bader knew I had studied Calculus
                for the Practical Man a little bit, so he gave me the real works -- it was for a junior or senior course
                in college. It had Fourier series, Bessel functions, determinants, elliptic functions -- all kinds of
                wonderful stuff that I didn't know anything about.
            </p>
            <p class="citation">
                That book also showed how to differentiate parameters under the integral sign -- it's a certain operation.
                It turns out that's not taught very much in the universities; they don't emphasize it. But I caught on
                how to use that method, and I used that one damn tool again and again. So because I was self-taught using
                that book, I had peculiar methods of doing integrals.
            </p>
            <p class="citation">
                The result was, when guys at MIT or Princeton had trouble doing a certain integral, it was because they
                couldn't do it with the standard methods they had learned in school. If it was contour integration, they
                would have found it; if it was a simple series expansion, they would have found it. Then I come along and
                try differentiating under the integral sign, and often it worked. So I got a great reputation for doing
                integrals, only because my box of tools was different from everybody else's, and they had tried all their
                tools on it before giving the problem to me."         
            </p>
        </p>

        <p>
            For me employing the trick felt like I was using cheat codes to deal with integrals while in the same
            time it enabled a lot of creativity and wishful thinking which at heart transformed the integrals into puzzles.
            Unfortunately in the same time this also means that there's not a clear path on how and when exactly to use
            this technique and also what Feynman wrote still applies today as the method isn't taught much or at all in the
            universities. This means that the technique often comes as obscure and hard to grasp for newcomers.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the following we will go into a journey to find some rules of thumb to have at disposal when using Feynman's trick.
            It should be mentioned right from the start that those rules of thumb are merely some heuristics that I tend to use, 
            so deviating from them can be totally fine, however I'm hoping that it can provide a path to have in case nothing
            obvious or intuitively occurs when someone tries to use this trick, or even better a reason for someone to start using the method.
        </p>

        <section id="chapter1"> <h3>Hello, World!</h3> </section>

        <p>
            Feynman already gave quite a big spoiler to what the trick is about when he mentioned about <b>differentiating under
            the integral sign</b> -- this also being an alternative name for the technique.
            More explicitly, if \(f(x,t)\) is well-behaved then the following holds:
            $$\frac{d}{dt} \int_a^b f(x, t)dx = \int_a^b \frac{\partial f(x, t)}{\partial t}dx$$
        <p>
            This looks pleasant, however a mere result is not much of an use in itself. One common thing that tends to
            happen while approaching something new, be it a game, a programming language or even a field is that 
            without practice nothing would stick. Take for example chess, most people could understand the rules in a few 
            minutes, however if they would go on to play a game most likely they would get stomped by a more experienced
            player while playing under the same rules, solely because the other player through practice learned some
            techniques to follow when playing. Therefore I would like here to jump straightforward into practice in order
            to get familiar with the trick.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a "Hello, World!" example let's take the following integral:
            $$I=\int_0^1 \frac{x-1}{\ln x}dx$$
            You are encouraged to try to evaluate the integral with the basic methods, but the logarithm being in the
            denominator makes this integral quite stubborn to deal with. Feynman's trick aims to get rid of this issue
            -- that is, to differentiate under the intgeral sign with respect to a parameter in order to obtain an
            integral that is easier to evaluate.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately in the integral from above we lack a parameter, therefore the first step is to complicate a bit
            the integral by introducing a new parameter, which we can call \(t\), thus the integral becomes:
            $$I(t)=\int_0^1 \frac{x^t-1}{\ln x}dx$$
            Keep in mind that our original integral is just \(I(1)\). Also surely, we could've placed parameter in many
            different places, such as:
            $$I(a)=\int_0^1 \frac{x-a}{\ln x}dx, \quad I(b)=\int_0^1 \frac{x-1}{b-\ln x}dx, \quad I(c)=\int_0^1 \frac{x-1}{\ln (cx)}dx\ ...$$
            However the main idea behind the trick, as mentioned above, is to obtain an integral that we can evaluate
            easier after differentiating with respect to the new parameter. Let's put this in action and see what happens to \(I(t)\).
            $$I'(t)=\int_0^1 \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\frac{x^t-1}{\ln x}\right)dx  = \int_0^1x^tdx = \frac{x^{t+1}}{t+1}\bigg|_0^1 = \frac{1}{t+1}$$
            Notice how easy it was to evaluate the integral \(I'(t)=\int_0^1x^tdx\) from above, had we kept \(I(a)\), \(I(b)\)
            or \(I(c)\) the things wouldn't had simplified after differentiating and most devastating is that we would still
            be left with the \(\ln x\) in the denominator, a thing which made the integral hard to deal with in the first place.
        </p>
        <p>
            We can already sense that the following might be an important question in the future:
            <b>Where to put the parameter when using Feynman's Trick?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            But we will worry about that later, for now let's finish the integral as we only found \(I'(t)\).
            Since we are looking to find \(I(t=1)\) we need to integrate \(I'(t)\) back in order to arrive there.
            Here it's useful to recall that:
            $$\int_a^b f'(x) dx = f(b)-f(a)$$
            For us \(f(x)\) is just \(I(t)\) in the above expression. Luckily \(I(0)=0\) and as we are looking for
            \(I=I(1)\) we can replace \(a\) with \(0\) and \(b\) with \(1\) yielding:
            $$I= I(1)-I(0)=\int_0^1 I'(t)dt = \int_0^1 \frac{1}{1+t}dt=\ln(1+t)\bigg|_0^1 = \ln 2.$$
            So that's the big picture of how Feynman's trick works -- we have an integral that is hard to evaluate
            it's original form, therefore by differentiating under the integral sign with respect to a parameter
            we attempt to transform the integral so that it can be easily integrated and in the end we go back to
            undo the differentiation step.

        <section id="chapter2"> <h3>Placing the parameter</h3> </section>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Let's start with our first rule of thumb, for which in order to describe we'll use another classic integral:
            $$I=\int_0^1 \frac{\ln(1+x)}{1+x^2}dx$$
            The first thing we need to do is to figure out where to put the parameter, so after differentiating with respect to it to obtain a simpler integral. The most annoying thing for us is the logarithm, therefore if we get rid of it everything should be straightforward, so there are a few parameter possibilities which makes sense to consider, namely:
            $$I(a)=\int_0^1\frac{\ln(a+x)}{1+x^2}dx, \quad I(b) = \int_0^1 \frac{\ln(1+bx)}{1+x^2}dx$$
            With the first one we are out of luck, as differentiating with respect to \(a\) gives:
            $$I'(a)=\int_0^1 \frac{1}{(a+x)(1+x^2)}dx = \frac{1}{1+a^2}\int_0^1\left(\frac{1}{a+x}+\frac{a}{1+x^2}-\frac{x}{1+x^2}\right)dx$$
            $$=\frac{\ln(1+a)}{1+a^2}-\frac{\ln a}{1+a^2} +\frac{\pi}{4}\frac{a}{1+a^2}-\frac{\ln 2}{2}\frac{1}{1+a^2}$$
            Therefore if we would try to go back to what we're looking, which is \(I(a=1)\), we would end up with something like \(I=I+\text{other stuff}\). This cancels out \(I\) and we wouldn't be able to recover it. Unfortunately there's no magic formula that tells whether placing a parameter in a specific place would succeed or fail dealing with an integral, but with practice this can become more intuitively.
        </p>
        <p>
            In contrast, things work out nicely with the second choice from above as:
            $$I'(b)=\int_0^1\frac{x}{(1+bx)(1+x^2)}dx=\frac{1}{1+b^2}\int_0^1\left(\frac{b}{1+x^2}+\frac{x}{1+x^2}-\frac{b}{1+bx}\right)dx$$
            $$=\frac{\pi}{4}\frac{b}{1+b^2}+\frac{\ln 2}{2}\frac{1}{1+b^2}-\frac{\ln(1+b)}{1+b^2}$$
            Here we are looking to find \(I(b=1)\) and as \(I(b=0) = 0\) we have:
            $$I=\int_0^1 I'(b)db \Rightarrow 2I=\int_0^1 \left(\frac{\pi}{4}\frac{b}{1+b^2}+\frac{\ln 2}{2}\frac{1}{1+b^2}\right)db \Rightarrow I=\frac{\pi}{8}\ln 2$$
        </p>
        <p>
            This works, but perhaps we can even do better. One thing that I always try to look for when using Feynman's trick is to simplify something from the integrand (in this case the denominator) while getting rid of the annoying stuff (the logarithm). With \(I(b)\) we only achieved the second thing.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to reach both things mentioned above, let's rewrite the original integral as:
            $$I=\int_0^1\frac{\ln(1+x)}{1+x^2}dx=\frac12\int_0^1\frac{\ln(1+2x+x^2)}{1+x^2}dx$$
        </p>
        <p>
            For this one it's naturally to choose the dummy variable so that it simplifies \(1+x^2\) when we differentiate with respect to \(t\), therefore we have:
            $$I(t)=\frac12\int_0^1 \frac{\ln(2x+t(1+x^2))}{1+x^2}dx\Rightarrow I'(t)=\frac12\int_0^1 \frac{1}{2x+t(1+x^2)}dx=\frac14\frac{\ln\left(\frac{1+\sqrt{1-t^2}}{t}\right)}{\sqrt{1-t^2}}$$
            Similarly to \(I(b)\) we are looking to find \(I(t=1)\), however here \(I(t=0)\) is equal to \(\frac12\int_0^1\frac{\ln(2x)}{1+x^2}dx\) not \(0\):
            $$I=I(1)-I(0)+I(0)=\frac14\int_0^1\frac{\ln\left(\frac{1+\sqrt{1-t^2}}{t}\right)}{\sqrt{1-t^2}}dt+\frac12\int_0^1\frac{\ln(2x)}{1+x^2}dx$$
            $$\int_0^1\frac{\ln\left(\frac{1+\sqrt{1-t^2}}{t}\right)}{\sqrt{1-t^2}}dt\overset{\frac{1+\sqrt{1-t^2}}{t}=x}=-2\int_0^1 \frac{\ln x}{1+x^2}dx\Rightarrow I = \frac12\int_0^1 \frac{\ln 2}{1+x^2}dx=\frac{\pi}{8}\ln 2$$
            However it might require more examples in order to feel why the above path is useful (in this case even using Feynman's trick was an overkill).
        </p>

            This is a different perspective to look at Feynman's trick, basically we will avoid the introduction of a parameter and instead switch fast-forward to double integrals.
            In order to see this in action let's go back to the "Hello, World!" integral:
            $$I=\int_0^1 \frac{x-1}{\ln x}dx$$
            As we saw there, after we introduced \(I(t)=\int_0^1 \frac{x^t-1}{\ln x}dx\) followed by differentiating w.r.t. \(t\) we were left with \(I'(t)=\int_0^1 x^t dx\), which means that \(I=\int_0^1\left(\int_0^1x^tdx\right)dt\). Therefore if we can observe that \(\int_0^1 x^tdt =\frac{x-1}{\ln x}\) (pay attention to \(dt\) here) then all we would have left to do is to switch the order of integration and evaluate the integral without introducing a parameter. There are a lot of words, so let's just write down what is meant above:
            $$\int_0^1 \frac{x-1}{\ln x}dx=\int_0^1\left(\int_0^1x^tdt\right)dx=\int_0^1\left(\int_0^1x^tdx\right)dt=\int_0^1 \left(\frac{x^{t+1}}{t+1}\bigg|_0^1\right)dt=\int_0^1\frac{1}{t+1}dt=\ln 2$$
            As another example let's look at one of our previous integral:
            $$I=\int_0^1 \frac{\ln(1+x)}{1+x^2}dx=\int_0^1 \int_0^1 \frac{x}{1+bx}\frac{1}{1+x^2}dbdx=\int_0^1 \int_0^1 \frac{x}{1+bx}\frac{1}{1+x^2}dxdb$$
            $$=\int_0^1 \left(\frac{\pi}{4}\frac{b}{1+b^2}+\frac{\ln 2}{2}\frac{1}{1+b^2}-\frac{\ln(1+b)}{1+b^2}\right)db\Rightarrow 2I=\int_0^1 \left(\frac{\pi}{4}\frac{b}{1+b^2}+\frac{\ln 2}{2}\frac{1}{1+b^2}\right)db$$
            And that \(I=\frac{\pi}{8}\ln 2\) is history already. This example was mainly used to exemplify that also only a part of the integrand can be replaced by another integral, in this case \(\ln(1+x)\) in contrast as replacing the whole integrand as in the example with \(\frac{x-1}{\ln x}\).

            As both methods are equivalent this didn't introduce anything new, however in the future chapter we will see some integrals that are more intuitively to deal with in the double integral form.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's put some sense in why seeing Feynman's trick as a double integral can be useful. As example we will take the following integral:
            $$I=\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{e^{-x^2}}{1+x^4}dx$$
            And now without any explanation I will introduce the following parameter (or rather function in this case):
            $$I(t)=\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{e^{-x^2}}{1+x^4} e^{-tx^2}(x^2\sin t+\cos t) dx$$
            The whole point is to simplify \(1+x^4\) (following our first rule of thumb) and the above function was made explicitly to achieve that, as \(\left(e^{-tx^2}(x^2\sin t+\cos t)\right)'=-(1+x^4)e^{-tx^2}\sin t\). Note that even though we introduced a couple other terms, those aren't that annoying.
            $$ I'(t)=-\sin t\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-x^2}e^{-tx^2}dx \overset{(1+t)x^2\to x^2}= -\frac{\sin t}{\sqrt{1+t}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-x^2}dx=-\sqrt \pi \frac{\sin t}{\sqrt{1+t}}$$
            Now we can observe that we are looking to find \(I=I(t=0)\) and that \(I(t\to\infty)=0\), therefore we have:
            $$I=-\int_0^\infty I'(t)dt=\sqrt \pi \int_0^\infty \frac{\sin t}{\sqrt{1+t}}dt\overset{\sqrt{1+t}=x}=2\sqrt \pi \int_1^\infty \sin(x^2-1)dx$$
            $$=2\sqrt{\pi} \cos 1 \int_1^\infty\sin(x^2)dx-2\sqrt{\pi} \sin  1 \int_1^\infty\cos(x^2)dx=\pi\cos 1\frac{1-2S\left(\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}}\right)}{\sqrt 2}-\pi\sin 1\frac{1-2C\left(\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}}\right)}{\sqrt 2}$$
            Where \(S(x)\) and \(C(x)\) are Fresnel integrals, however the result itself isn't that important here.
        </p>
        <p>
            The method on the other hand is quite useful to bring some intuition on some future integrals. Put into a different perspective all we did above was to replace \(\frac{1}{1+x^4}\) with \(\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2t}\sin t \, dt\), so alternatively we can simply rewrite the integral as a double integral in order to avoid the differentiation step.

        <p>
            For example here are some of the most useful, starting with one from above:
            $$\int_0^\infty e^{-xt}\sin t dt =\frac{1}{1+x^2}, \quad \int_0^\infty e^{-xt} dt = \frac{1}{x}, \quad \int_0^\infty e^{-xt^2}dt = \frac{1}{\sqrt x}$$
            Let's end this chapter by evaluating one of the most popular integrals that appears when Feynman's trick gets into the conversation, namely:
            $$I=\int_0^\infty \frac{\sin x}{x}dx$$
            Since \(\int_0^\infty e^{-xt} dt = \frac{1}{x}\) we can make use of this to rewrite the integral as:
            $$I=\int_0^\infty \int_0^\infty \sin x e^{-xt}dtdx = \int_0^\infty \int_0^\infty \sin x e^{-xt}dxdt=\int_0^\infty \frac{1}{1+t^2}dt =\frac{\pi}{2}$$
            Alternatively we can also introduce the parameter version of the integral:
            $$I(t)=\int_0^\infty \frac{\sin x}{x}e^{-xt}dx\Rightarrow I'(t)=-\int_0^\infty \sin x e^{-xt} dx=-\frac{1}{1+t^2}$$
            And the rest goes as expected as we have:
            $$I=I(t=0)=-\int_0^\infty I'(t)dt = \int_0^\infty \frac{1}{1+t^2}dt = \frac{\pi}{2}$$
            For more practice one play with another popular integral, namely the Fresnel integral:
            $$\int_0^\infty \sin(x^2)dx=?$$
            As a hint, substitute \(x^2\to x\) in order to arrive at a form where we can use the method described in this chapter.

            It's also useful to introduce another rule of thumb when cleansing the integrals. We'll see what exactly while dealing with the following integral:
            $$I=\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2}\ln(2+\tan^2 x)dx$$
            There are two obvious parameters to consider here:
            $$I(a)=\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2}\ln(a+\tan^2 x)dx,\quad I(b)=\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2}\ln(2+b\tan^2 x)dx$$
            Turns out both works, let's stick with the first one and you are welcome to play with the last one.
            $$I'(a)=\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2}\frac{1}{a+\tan^2 x}dx\overset{\tan x\to x}=\int_0^\infty \frac{1}{(a+x^2)(1+x^2)}dx$$
            $$=\frac{1}{1-a}\int_0^\infty\left(\frac{1}{a+x^2}-\frac{1}{1+x^2}\right)dx=\frac{\pi}{2}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt a (1-a)}-\frac{1}{1-a}\right)=\frac{\pi}{2}\frac{1}{\sqrt a+a}$$
            In this case we are looking to find \(I=I(a=2)\) and as \(I(a=0)=\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2}\ln(\tan^2 x) dx\) is equal to \(0\) since after the substitution \(x\to\frac{\pi}{2}-x\) \(\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2}\ln(\tan^2 x) dx = - \int_0^\frac{\pi}{2}\ln(\tan^2 x) dx\), the original integral is:
            $$I=\int_0^2 I'(a)da=\frac{\pi}{2}\int_0^2\frac{1}{\sqrt a+a}da\overset{a=x^2}=\pi\int_0^\sqrt 2\frac{1}{1+x}dx=\pi\ln(1+\sqrt 2)$$
            While this works, we can do better. Another rule of thumb that I tend to use is to stick with rational functions as they often provide the most visibility to work with. Let's do that for our integral too:
            $$I=\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2}\ln(2+\tan^2 x)dx\overset{\tan x\to x}=\int_0^\infty \frac{\ln(2+x^2)}{1+x^2}dx$$
            At this point, if we remember the first rule of thumb, mainly to <b>place the parameter in order to simplify something from the integrand</b>, then it should be obvious where to place the parameter so that we can simplify the denominator. We have:
            $$I(t)=\int_0^\infty \frac{\ln(1+t(1+x^2))}{1+x^2}dx\Rightarrow I'(t)=\int_0^\infty \frac{1}{1+t+tx^2}dx=\frac{\pi}{2}\frac{1}{\sqrt t\sqrt{1+t}}$$
            Let's finish this integral too as we are looking for \(I=I(t=1)\) with \(I(t=0) = 0\):
            $$I=\int_0^1I'(t)dt=\frac{\pi}{2}\int_0^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt t\sqrt{1+t}}dx\overset{t=x^2}=\pi\int_0^1\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}dx=\pi\ln(1+\sqrt 2)$$
            The main advantage over the previous method here was that we avoided doing partial fractions, which is not that much. However now we have a path to follow in the future as if possible the first step would be to transform the integral to contain rational functions, instead of trigonometric ones for example.
        </p>
        <p>
            Obviously, if you're more used to trigonometric functions and you do have a great visibility when evaluating integrals containing them, then this can be simply ignored. I however tend to switch fast to rational functions so in what's to come I will almost always do this as a first step, a few exceptions will be shown in the future, mainly when at least one of the bounds is \(\infty\) then one shouldn't try to change the trigonometric functions.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to practice further with both rules of thumbs, I propose the following integral:
            $$\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2} \ln(\sec^2 x+\tan^4 x)dx=?$$
