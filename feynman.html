                The first time that I saw Feynman's trick it was also the time that I started to love evaluating integrals. At that point I was only finishing high school and mostly have dealt with basic integrals, however afterwards I started to approach math as a hobby and evaluating integrals became for me something like a puzzle.. similar to how some people enjoy solve anagrams, sudoku games and so on. Feynman's trick provided a cheat code to deal with integrals.

				In order to describe the trick it's easier to just show how an integral is evaluated using this method. We'll start with the following integral:
                $$I=\int_0^1 \frac{x-1}{\ln x}dx$$
            </p>
            <p>
				The first step is to complicate a bit the integral by introducing a new parameter, a dummy variable, which we can call \(t\), thus the integral becomes:
				$$I(t)=\int_0^1 \frac{x^t-1}{\ln x}dx$$
				Keep in mind that our original integral is just \(I(1)\). Also surely, we could've placed the dummy variable in many different places, such as:
				$$I(a)=\int_0^1 \frac{x-a}{\ln x}dx, \quad I(b)=\int_0^1 \frac{x-1}{b-\ln x}dx, \quad I(c)=\int_0^1 \frac{x-1}{\ln (cx)}dx\ ...$$
				The reason why the original \(I(t)\) was chosen is to be seen in the next step, which is to differentiate the integral with respect to \(t\). This looks like:
				$$I'(t)=\int_0^1 \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\frac{x^t-1}{\ln x}\right)dx  = \int_0^1x^tdx=\frac{x^{t+1}}{t+1}\bigg|_0^1 =\frac{1}{t+1}$$
				Notice how easy was to evaluate the integral \(I'(t)=\int_0^1x^tdx\) above, had we kept \(I(a)\) or \(I(b)\) the things wouldn't had simplified at all after differentiating with respect to \(a\) or respectively \(b\).<br>
				We can already sense that the following might be an important question in the future: Where to put the parameter when using Feynman's Trick?
            </p>
            <p>
                But we will worry about that later, for now let's finish the integral as we only found \(I'(t)\).<br>
				Since we are looking to find \(I(t=1)\) we need to integrate \(I'(t)\) back in order to arrive there. Here it's useful to recall that:
				$$\int_a^b f'(x) dx = f(x)\bigg|_a^b$$
				For us \(f(x)\) is just \(I(t)\) in the above expression. Luckily \(I(0)=0\) and as we are looking for \(I=I(1)\) we can replace \(a\) with \(0\) and \(b\) with \(1\) yielding:
				$$I=\int_0^1 I'(t)dt = \int_0^1 \frac{1}{1+t}dt=\ln(1+t)\bigg|_0^1 = \ln 2.$$
				So that's the big picture of Feynman's trick.
            </p>

				Here is a follow up integral for you in order to practice with the method presented above:
				$$\int_0^1 \frac{x^2-x}{\ln x}dx = ?$$
