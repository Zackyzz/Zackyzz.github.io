            While in some movies the plot can get a bit ambitious and use the notion of quantum physics to introduce concepts such as time travel, teleportation and various magically working gadgets - that defy our everyday understanding of physics - it is also true that quantum physics, which deals with how things work at the atomic level, behaves in a different way than our intuition is used to.
        </p>

            Quantum computers are based on the principles of quantum physics, and although they will not help with the time-traveling part, they do possess some advantages over classical computers and are envisioned to help us solve problems that wouldn't be feasible with the current technology.
        </p>

        <p>
            It's worth noting that a classical computer is a Turing machine, which means that it's theoretically capable of implementing any computer algorithm - even one that simulates a quantum computer - but this assumes that we have infinite time and memory at our disposal. So rather said, a quantum computer can help us solve tasks more efficiently than a classical computer, which could even mean that something that would require hundreds of years to perform classically can be reduced to a matter of minutes.

            At a low level, in an ordinary computer, everything in the software part is made out of bits. A <span class ="important-text">bit</span> is the basic unit of information which represents two possible states. In a physical representation, some circuits can recognize a voltage lower than \(0.8V\) as one state, whereas the other possible state can be identified by a voltage higher than \(2.2V\).
        </p>

        <p>
            In a computer representation, these two states are however simplified to \(0\) and \(1\). Fortunately for us, the bits are hidden by high-level routines which makes our life way easier, as it would be burdensome to manipulate them into performing a desired task.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, to better contrast with what's to come, let's stick to the level of bits. We can represent these \(0\) and \(1\) states using some equivalent vectors, as:
        </p>
        \[\newcommand\col[1]{\begin{bmatrix}#1\end{bmatrix}}\]
        \[ 0:=\col{1 \\ 0}, \quad 1:=\col{0 \\ 1}\]

        <p>
            Having a single bit, all that we can do is switch from \(0\) to \(1\) back and forth. Using the standard logical NOT gate we directly have:
        </p>
        \[ \operatorname{NOT}(0) = 1,\quad \operatorname{NOT}(1) =0\]
        <p>
            Furthermore, the \(\operatorname{NOT}\) operator, performed to the vector representation of the bits, takes the form of a marix, namely:
        </p>
        \[\operatorname{NOT} = \col{0 \quad 1 \\ 1 \quad 0}\]
        \[\Rightarrow \operatorname{NOT}(0) = \operatorname{NOT} \col{1 \\ 0} =  \col{0 \quad 1 \\ 1 \quad 0}\cdot \col{1 \\ 0} = \col{0 \\ 1} = 1\]
        \[\Rightarrow \operatorname{NOT}(1) = \operatorname{NOT} \col{0 \\ 1} =  \col{0 \quad 1 \\ 1 \quad 0}\cdot \col{0 \\ 1} = \col{1 \\ 0} = 0\]

        <p>
            In contrast to bits, the fundamental unit of information in quantum computing is the <span class ="important-text">qubit</span>. A qubit isn't limited to only two states, and instead, it is represented by a two-dimensional vector. This means that a qubit can exist in an infinite number of states, but with the following constraint taken into account:
        </p>
        \[\col{a \\ b}, \quad |a|^2+|b|^2 = 1; \ a,b\in \mathbb{C}\]

        <p>
            This principle is analogous to that of probabilities, where for any event, the probabilities for all its outcomes must sum up to \(1\). However, for a qubit, those values should be squared, and also taken in modulus (this matters only if \(a\) or \(b\) are complex numbers).
        </p>

        <p>
            In order to grasp this concept visually, we will assume that we work with real numbers for now. Therefore, the state space for a single qubit can be visualized as any point on the circumference of a unit circle, as seen below.
        </p>

        <p>
            To differentiate between classical bits, in the picture from above a new notation was introduced - \(\ket{\cdot}\) - called "ket", which denotes a special kind of column vector which represents a quantum state. Also, two special cases corresponding to the classical bits \(0\) and \(1\) can be distinguished as:
        </p>

        \[\require{braket}
        \ket{0} = \col{1 \\ 0}; \quad \ket{1} = \col{0 \\ 1}
        \]

        <p>
            Using this, any quantum states can be represented as a linear combination of \(\ket{0}\) and \(\ket{1}\):
        </p>
        
        \[
        \col{a \\ b} = a \col{1 \\ 0} + b\col{0 \\ 1} = a \ket{0} + b \ket{1}
        \]
