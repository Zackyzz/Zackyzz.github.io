            While in some movies the plot can get a bit overambitious and use the notion of quantum physics to introduce concepts such as time travel, teleportation and various magically working gadgets - which cannot be explained based on our day-to-day experiences of physics - it is also true that quantum physics, which deals with how things at an atomic level work, behaves in a different way than our intuition is used to.
        </p>

        <p>
            Quantum computers are based on the properties of quantum physics and, although they will not help with the time-traveling part, they do possess some power over classical computers and can help us solve tasks that would not be possible with current technology.
        </p>

        <p>
            It should be mentioned that a classical computer is a Turing machine, which means that it is capable of implementing any computer algorithm - even one that simulates a quantum computer - but this assumes that we have infinite time and memory at our disposal. Rather, quantum computers can help us solve tasks more efficiently than a classical computer, which could even mean that something that would require hundreds of years to perform can be reduced to a matter of minutes.

            At a low level, in an ordinary computer, everything is made of bits. A bit is the basic unit of information which represents two possible states - in a physical representation, some circuits recognize a voltage lower than \(0.8V\) as a state, whereas the other state can be identified by a voltage higher than \(2.2V\) - in a logical representation, however, the two states are simplified to \(0\) and \(1\). Fortunately for us, the bits are hidden by high-level routines which make life way easier, as it would be burdensome to manipulate them into performing a desired task.
        </p>

        <p>
            In contrast, for a quantum computer, the fundamental unit of information is the <span class ="important">qubit</span>. However, a qubit is not limited to only two states, and instead, it can be represented as a two-dimensional vector, taking into account the constraint from below:
        </p>
        
        \[\newcommand\col[1]{\begin{bmatrix}#1\end{bmatrix}}
        \col{a \\ b}, \quad |a|^2+|b|^2 = 1; \ a,b\in \mathbb{C}\]

        <p>
            This is similar to probabilities, where for any event, the probabilities for all its outcomes must sum to \(1\), but for a qubit, those should be squared and also taken in modulus (if \(a\) and \(b\) are complex numbers).
        </p>

        <p>
            Without loss of generality, we will assume that we work only with real numbers for now. Therefore, the state space for a single qubit can be visualized as any point on the surface of a unit circle, as seen below.
        </p>

        <img src="imgs/unit_circ.jpg" alt="Quantum" class = "qcircle">

        <p>
            For ease of notation, we introduced above a new notation: \(\ket{\cdot}\), called "ket", which simply represents a vector. Also, two special cases corresponding to the classical bits \(0\) and \(1\) can be distinguished as:
        </p>

        \[\require{braket}
        \ket{0} = \col{1 \\ 0}; \quad \ket{1} = \col{0 \\ 1}
        \]

        <p>
            Using this, the two basis states for a qubit can be represented as \(\ket{0}\) and \(\ket{1}\), and any general state of a qubit can be expressed as a linear combination of these two basis states:
        </p>
        
        \[
        \col{a \\ b} = a \col{1 \\ 0} + b\col{0 \\ 1} = a \ket{0} + b \ket{1}
        \]

        <p>
            Another example of a qubit (seen in the above picture) is \(\ket{+}\), which is quite special since for this state \(a\) and \(b\) are equal (this happens when \(a=b=\frac{1}{\sqrt 2}\)).
        </p>

        \[
        \ket{+} = \frac{1}{\sqrt 2} \ket{0} + \frac{1}{\sqrt 2} \ket{1} = \col{\frac{1}{\sqrt 2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt 2}}
        \]
