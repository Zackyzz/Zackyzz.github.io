            While in some movies the plot can get a bit overambitious and use the notion of quantum physics to introduce concepts such as time travel, teleportation and various magically working gadgets - that defy our everyday understanding of physics - it is also true that quantum physics, which deals with how things work at the atomic and subatomic scales, behaves in a different way than our intuition is used to.
        </p>

            Quantum computers are based on the principles of quantum physics, and although they will not help with the time-traveling part, they do possess some advantages over classical computers, and can help us solve tasks that would not be possible with the current technology.
        </p>

        <p>
            It's worth noting that a classical computer is a Turing machine, which means that it is theoretically capable of implementing any computer algorithm - even one that simulates a quantum computer - but this assumes that we have infinite time and memory at our disposal. So rather said, a quantum computer can help us solve tasks more efficiently than a classical computer, which could even mean that something that would require hundreds of years to perform classically can be reduced to a matter of minutes.

            At a low level, in an ordinary computer, everything is made out of bits. A bit is the basic unit of information which represents two possible states. In a physical representation, some circuits recognize a voltage lower than \(0.8V\) as a state, whereas the other state can be identified by a voltage higher than \(2.2V\).
        </p>
        <p>
            In computing terminology, these two states are however simplified to \(0\) and \(1\). Fortunately for us, the bits are hidden by high-level routines which makes our life way easier, as it would be burdensome to manipulate them into performing a desired task.
        </p>

        <p>
            In contrast to bits, the fundamental unit of information in quantum computing is the <span class ="important-text">qubit</span>. A qubit is not limited to only two states, and instead, it can be represented as a two-dimensional vector, taking into account the constraint from below:
        </p>
        
        \[\newcommand\col[1]{\begin{bmatrix}#1\end{bmatrix}}
        \col{a \\ b}, \quad |a|^2+|b|^2 = 1; \ a,b\in \mathbb{C}\]

        <p>
            This principle is analogous as for probabilities, where for any event, the probabilities for all its outcomes must sum to \(1\). However, for a qubit, those values should be squared, and also taken in modulus (if \(a\) and \(b\) are complex numbers).
        </p>

        <p>
            In order to grasp this concept visually, we will assume that we work with real numbers for now. Therefore, the state space for a single qubit can be visualized as any point on the circumference of a unit circle, as seen below.
        </p>

        <p>
            To differentiate between classical bits, we introduced in the picture from above a new notation: \(\ket{\cdot}\), called "ket", which denotes a special kind of vector which represents a quantum state. Also, two special cases corresponding to the classical bits \(0\) and \(1\) can be distinguished as:
        </p>

        \[\require{braket}
        \ket{0} = \col{1 \\ 0}; \quad \ket{1} = \col{0 \\ 1}
        \]

        <p>
            Using this, any quantum states can be represented as a linear combination of \(\ket{0}\) and \(\ket{1}\):
        </p>
        
        \[
        \col{a \\ b} = a \col{1 \\ 0} + b\col{0 \\ 1} = a \ket{0} + b \ket{1}
        \]
