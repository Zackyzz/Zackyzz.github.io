            While in some movies the plot can get a bit overambitious and use the notion of quantum physics to get into the picture stuff like time travel or other magically working gadgets - basically stuff that we can't explain based on our day to day experiences of physics - it is also true that quantum physics, which deals with how things at an atomic level works, behaves in a way different than our intuition is used to.
        </p>

        <p>
            In turn quantum computers are based on the properties of quantum physics and although it will not help with the time travelling part, it does possess some power over classical computers and can help us solve tasks which would not be possible with current technology.
        </p>

            Regarding the last sentence, it should be noted that a computer computer as we know it, is a Turing machine, which means that it is capable of implementing any computer algorithm - even to simulate a quantum computer - however this assumes that we have infinite time and memory at our disposal. So rather: quantum computers can help us solve tasks in a more efficient way than on a classical computer, which could even mean that something which would require hundreds of years to solve can be reduced to a matter of minutes.

            In this essay, the aim is to describe and provide some intuition on how quantum computing works at a basic level from a programming perspective, but also to show why would someone care about this field.

            On a classical computer a bit can have two possible states, namely 0 and 1. In contrast the equivalent of those bits are called qubits, which can be described as unit vectors like:
        </p>
        <pre>
        <code>
        0 -> [1 0]
        1 -> [0 1]
        </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            In addition to this, a qubit can be found in a linear combination of the two possible states mentioned above, under the condition that the state will always be a unit vector.
        </p>
        <pre>
        <code>
        a[1 0] + b[0 1] = [a b], a^2 + b^2 = 1
        </code>
        </pre>
