                Why Racket?
            </h1>
            <p>
                I don't think there's such thing as a bad programmer, but there are definitely some who don't like programming, some who can't focus when writing code or simply can't think in such a way as to give instructions and write a program. I was one of those
                in my first years in college when I fist started programming, at that time I felt like that wasn't for me and it's quite hard to describe the felling.. mostly I just didn't enjoy it enough as to focus more on it.
            </p>
            <p>
                This went on until my third year in college when I took a class of Artificial Intelligence, there in the laboratory course the proffessor insisted to use for teaching a programming language called Lisp, even though most of the students and even other
                teachers suggested other stuff, like Python.
            </p>
            <p>
                In short I was forced to learn Lisp and at first the syntax annoyed me so much that I understood why LISP stood for "Lots of Irrelevant and Stupid Paranthesis". However after a short time I started liking Lisp, it was different than any programming I
                have used until that point, basically a breath of fresh air, where I felt like what I had in my mind can easily be translated into code.
            </p>
            <p>
                At first I used Common Lisp, but I disliked that it lacked any support so my next choices were between Racket and Clojure. If I had been using Linux at that time, probably I could've favored Clojure more, however as Racket had a great IDE (DrRacket),
                great documentation and most important easily access to work with a GUI, I've chosen Racket. So in what's to come the code will be written in Racket on this page.
